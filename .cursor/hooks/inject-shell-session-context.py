"""Pre-shell hook: bridge the host's session identity into task.py.

No researched platform exports a session id into its shell tool's child
process, but every hook-capable one puts that id on hook stdin. So the hook
that fires just before a shell command writes a short-lived runtime ticket
whenever the pending command calls `task.py start/current/finish`, and the
task script consumes it when it has no native session environment.

Registered on whichever pre-shell event the host provides — Cursor's
`beforeShellExecution`, Claude-shaped `PreToolUse`, Gemini's `BeforeTool` —
which is why the only thing here that knows about payload variation is
`_pending_shell_command`.
